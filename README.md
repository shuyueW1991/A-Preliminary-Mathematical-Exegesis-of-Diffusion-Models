_A minimalist black-and-white sketch of a human figure gazing at the stars, carved into rough stone with ancient, weathered textures. The style is simple line art, evoking primal cave paintings or petroglyphs, conveying wonder and timeless connection to the cosmos."_

_A primitive black-and-white line engraving depicting ancient artisans smelting and crafting bronze vessels. Scenes show craftsmen gesturing over designs and finished artifacts, all carved into weathered stone with rough chisel marks. Stylized as minimalist petroglyphs, evoking early foundry rituals and metallurgical knowledge."_

_"An abstract black-and-white petroglyph depicting a tunnel or portal, carved into rough stone with primal chisel marks. Minimalist line art suggests motion—repeating arched shapes or concentric circles fading into darkness, evoking ancient symbolism of passage and unknown realms. Weathered cracks and uneven edges enhance the archaic, symbolic feel."_

_"A primitive black-and-white stone carving depicting a farmer harvesting crops. Stylized as minimalist petroglyphs—bold outlines of a figure with a sickle, sheaves of grain, and sun symbols, all chiseled into rough rock with weathered textures. The scene evokes ancient agricultural rituals, using negative space and uneven lines to suggest movement and labor."_

i should sometimes  clarify what we aim for, short-term and long-term.
 and should display  all natural thinkings on something, not missing any one of them. cause that's what a subconcious flow of a math thinker would do.
